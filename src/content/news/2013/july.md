<p>Trying to work out the best update model for the different repo's is starting to take shape for core and main. &nbsp;There will be two kernels in use, one stable, well-tested, only available once a new major release reaches 3.x.8 or above, the unstable kernel is linux-next, and is fully following upstream releases. &nbsp;This way, linux-next will be an excellent test ground for the next stable release.</p>
<p>KDE has made 4.11 pre-releases available, and after testing those for 3 weeks, there are no issues to stop from moving to 4.11 early, 4.10.90 has moved to the stable repo's.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot2" width="443" height="280" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-675" />Work continues to give KaOS it's own identity with new custom themes. &nbsp;In use is now a grayscale theme for grub, kdm, ksplash and wallpaper. &nbsp;Gfxboot is not fully converted yet. &nbsp;For the foreseeable future there will be no public release though. &nbsp;Where development currently is for this distro, it is far better and easier to keep it as private.</p>
