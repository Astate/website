<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1120" src="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/available_updates-150x150.png" alt="available_updates" width="150" height="150" /> KaOS stayed with Samba 3 as long as possible, maintenance from upstream was still active until last December. But it was announced, the 3 series is no longer maintained, so time to move to 4.</p>
<p>4.1.5 introduces quite a few new dependencies and is a major change.<br />
