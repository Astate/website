:::tip
Getting bugs fixed is an important, if not crucial part of the quality assurance for any project. To be able to solve any issue stands and falls with how a bug report is created. See [Asking and Reporting the Smart Way](http://kaosx.us/docs/) for a basic guideline to create useful reports.

### When reporting try to include:

- Basic hardware info
- Preferably the outcome of _Octopi > Tools > SysInfo_
- Version of the effected Applications
- Exact name & date of the used ISO for installation issues
- Logs
- Screenshots
