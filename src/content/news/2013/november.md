<p>A little later News article then the usual first week of the month.  It was thought best to combine, show what has been worked on, and make the announcement of a first publicly released ISO.</p>
<p>The regular updates to the repositories continued, these include KDE 4.11.3, Linux 3.11.7, new phonon packages, latest GIMP, Chrome among the about 900 updated.  KDE 4.11.80 Beta1 is a new addition for the more adventurous who want to try the very latest.</p>
<p>But the last two weeks most work has been geared toward getting KaOS-2013.11 ISO as much ready as possible for a public release.</p>
<p>Big thanks flies out to <a class="fancybox-iframe" href="https://yoyo308.com/" title="yoy308">yoyo</a> for his tireless blogging about KaOS, recruiting many testers, helping anyone with questions about KaOS and explaining to them the pros and cons of this distribution.<br />
The help of the translators dagodex, holmes, zvacet, masseus and spanishbizarro is really appreciated, thanks to them the Installer is available in quite a few languages now.</p>
<p>Mcder3 got the plasma theme ready for the latest changes (plasma-nm replaced the networkmanager applet).</p>
<p>It is now possible to have an installation guide helping you while doing the installation:</p>
<p>For any additional info about this release, check the.</p>
