Due to the file system used for compressing the KaOS ISO, creating a bootable DVD ISO needs one clear warning:
:::caution
Any burn-speed used above 4x will likely result in an unusable DVD. On virtual all Linux Distributions, this is no issue.
:::

The native Windows ISO burn program does not give you the option to set at 4x. There are several free options available though for Windows, [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download) is one of them.
